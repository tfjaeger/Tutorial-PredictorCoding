Even if you embed most figures into your R markdown code and generate them directly into the PDF, DOC, or HTML, you will likely want 
to store at least some figures in separate files---for example, because you want to import them into posters, presentations, 
or papers. 

As with everything else, use verbose names that allow you to recognize what is in the file without having to open it. In any non-trivial
project, you will likely generate quite a few files, and you will regret later if you didn't go through the trouble of using transparent
filenames earlier in your project.
