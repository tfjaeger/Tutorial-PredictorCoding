Even if you embed most result tables into your R markdown code and generate them directly into the PDF, DOC, or HTML, you will likely want 
to store at least some tables in separate files---for example, you might want to generate latex output for tables so that you can import the
files without typing into another document.

As with everything else, use verbose names that allow you to recognize what is in the file without having to open it. In any non-trivial
project, you will likely generate quite a few files, and you will regret later if you didn't go through the trouble of using transparent
filenames earlier in your project.
